# AWS OpenTelemetry for JavaScript

## Introduction

This project contains components of the [OpenTelemetry JavaScript](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js) configured for use with AWS X-Ray. Please check out the upstream project to get a better understanding of the underlying features, APIs, and SDKs. This repository only contains a small portion of components which will allow OpenTelemetry to work with AWS X-Ray and the OpenTelemetry repository contains the rest.

We provided an IdGenerator and Propagator which can be called in a custom configuration from the OpenTelemetry upstream API. The telemetry data can be exported in a variety of formats and can be configured via command lines or environment variables. The aim of this project is to able to gather telemetry data from a JavaScript application and export trace data to an AWS-XRay backend.

## Getting Started

Check out the [getting started documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/javascript-sdk).

## Supported Runtimes

For the complete list of supported runtimes, please refer to the upstream documentation [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/master/README.md#supported-runtimes)

## How it works

The [OpenTelemetry JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js) provides entry points with methods used for configuring aspects through its [API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/75ae34c0a27ab6a7c618a1f899fe69e3cede51f9/packages/opentelemetry-api). This custom configuration allows us to reconfigure the [IdsGenerator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/221ced81d97bd78c839a366f0a77282ea9d5b1ee/packages/opentelemetry-core/src/platform/node/RandomIdGenerator.ts) which is needed in order to support X-Ray compatible trace Ids format. In addition, we are also able to use a custom propagator which is passed into the tracer provider to conform to AWS X-Ray headers.
